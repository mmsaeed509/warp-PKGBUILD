### PKGBUILD For Warp Terminal

at first, you should know how AppImage works

AppImage works like Docker, as it containerizes the app, it gives you a self-contained file.

This file bundles the application along with all its required libraries and dependencies, making it independent of your specific Linux distribution.

> **_FYI:_** 
> 
> **AppImage relies on a technology called SquashFS, which efficiently compresses the application and its dependencies into a single file.**
> **When you run the AppImage, the system temporarily mounts it, making its contents accessible to the application.**

as it works like Docker it also:

- **Read-Only Design**

  - AppImages are designed to be read-only, ensuring they don't tamper with your system files or interfere with other applications. This also enhances security, as any malicious code within the AppImage is confined to itself.

- **Isolation and Portability**

  - Since AppImage doesn't touch your system files, it runs in a self-contained environment. This allows you to easily move AppImages between different Linux systems without compatibility issues.

Docker Vs AppImage:

**AppImage:**

* **Focus:** Desktop applications with graphical interfaces (GUIs).
* **Goal:** Simple, portable execution without system modification.
* **Tech:** Single file containing bundled app and dependencies.
* **Interaction:** Double-click to run, no installation needed.
* **Isolation:** Limited, shares host kernel and libraries.
* **Updates:** Manual by downloading new AppImage versions.

**Docker:**

* **Focus:** Server-side applications and processes, often command-line based.
* **Goal:** Consistent, isolated environment across diverse systems.
* **Tech:** Layers of filesystem images defining app and environment.
* **Interaction:** Build or pull images, run containers from those images.
* **Isolation:** Strong, uses its own virtual filesystem and minimal host resources.
* **Updates:** Defined within the image, can be automated.

**Key Differences:**

* **Target audience:** AppImage for end-users, Docker for developers and DevOps.
* **Complexity:** AppImage simpler, Docker requires more configuration.
* **Isolation:** Docker stronger, more secure for potentially risky applications.
* **Updates:** AppImage manual, Docker can be automated using repositories.
* **Integration:** AppImage less integrated with the system, Docker can be more integrated.
